1. Add your own notebooks in the "notebooks" folder.
2. Push to `master` until we agree on a more sophisticated approach.
3. Add required notebook dependencies (both R and Python) to `environment.yml`
4. If possible, try to add data table column names to the `notebooks/constants.py` file (or define at the top of notebooks), and use those constants in your visualization code.
